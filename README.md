# StateViz

**Interactive playground for blockchain data structures**

Understanding how blockchains organize and manage data is crucial for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. StateViz makes complex blockchain data structures accessible through interactive visualizations.

## Mission

**Make blockchain data structures understandable through hands-on exploration.**

Too many developers treat blockchain data structures as black boxes. StateViz breaks them open, letting you see exactly how data flows, how nodes connect, and why these structures are so powerful.
